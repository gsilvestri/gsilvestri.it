      hello culture<br />
      we have culture<br />
      it's the best culture
    </p>

    <h4 class="subtitle">Working at MDG</h4>

    <p>
      We do fun team building events, host conferences, host meetups, get dinner together, go on trips,
      etc. Every quarter(?) we have everyone on our team fly to SF headquarters, usually for some
      sort of launch, and we plan team events while everyone is in town.
    </p>

    <h4 class="subtitle">Global Team</h4>

    <p>
      We look into various aspects of our culture when thinking about inclusiveness, one in particular is
      how we think about our remote team members. We use the latest systems possible to connect our remote
      employees: Collaboration apps like Slack and Dropbox Paper, VPN-less access to all systems, high-quality
      videoconferencing and top-of-the-line AV equipment. We strongly believe that face to face interaction
      is a key part of building a strong team, so we’ve put together a travel calendar for our remote team
      members to come to HQ to work and celebrate with the SF based team 2–4 times a year.
