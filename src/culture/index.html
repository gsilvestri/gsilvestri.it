    <h2 class="pagetitle">Our culture</h2>

    <p>
      Culture isn't about the kombucha in the fridge, the XBox game room, or mission statement posters
      on the walls. It's about the people in a company, the values they share, and how they work to
      achieve goals together.
    </p>

    <p>
      At MDG, we strive for excellence just like every other company, but it's the way we get there makes
      us different. We strive for kindness and transparency, and in the spirit of open-source, we're
      able to openly give each other feedback in candid and constructive manners. As a result, we're
      constantly teaching and learning from each other, and therefore constantly growing both professionally
      and personally.

    <h4 class="subtitle">Life at MDG</h4>

    <p>
      We're a small, tight-knit team. In our San Francisco office, we eat lunch together every day,
      often paired with a hot sauce carefully chosen from our curated “hot sauce wall” by our in-house
      expert, Nick Martin (CTO/Co-Founder). For those who are around in the evenings, we also eat dinner
      together, ordering food from a selection of our favorite local restaurants. We have daily
      traditions like going for coffee walks on beautiful SF days, and going out to dinner
      together on Friday, especially when our remoterites are in town.

    <p>
      Core to our culture is also interacting with our open source community. Once a month we host a
      meetup for our open source communities, attracting hundreds of developers to our office to listen
      to talks, celebrate, etc.

    <p>
      We do fun team building events, host conferences, host meetups, get dinner together, go on trips,
      etc. Every quarter(?) we have everyone on our team fly to SF headquarters, usually for some
      sort of launch, and we plan team events while everyone is in town.

      There's a difference between work culture and social culture. Our employees attend a lot of
      conferences.
