    <h2 class="pagetitle">Culture at Meteor</h2>

    <p>
      Culture isn't about the kombucha in the fridge, the ping pong table upstairs, or the super hero
      pictures on the walls. It's about the people in a compan, and the way their personalities
      intersect. Culture is about the way people prefer to work and interact, and it all starts with the
      founders of the company.
    </p>

    <p>
      At MDG, we strive for execution, just like every other company. It's the way we get there makes
      us different. We strive for kindness and transparency. It's critical in an open source company
      that we are able to openly give feedback in a constructive manner - and that's what the combination
      of kindness and transparency gives us. As a result, we teach and therefore we help each other grow.

    <p>
      We're a small team. In our San Francisco office, we eat lunch together every day, have dinners,
      go on coffee walks, host meetups, etc.

    <h4 class="subtitle">Working at MDG</h4>

    <p>
      We do fun team building events, host conferences, host meetups, get dinner together, go on trips,
      etc. Every quarter(?) we have everyone on our team fly to SF headquarters, usually for some
      sort of launch, and we plan team events while everyone is in town.
