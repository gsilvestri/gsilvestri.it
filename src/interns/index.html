  <h2 class="pagetitle">University Recruiting</h2>

  <p>
    We're a team of listeners and advocates, mentors and hosts. Our interns are treated like full-time employees, working on
    high-impact code on the projects and with the people of their choosing. We look for interns who are hard-working, eager
    to learn, and excited to try new things and join a small team of passionate people. We view the recruiting process as
    a shared adventure and look forward to meeting you!
  </p>

  <p>
    Our 2017 summer interns worked on everything from building a GraphQL proxy for an upcoming commercial product, to implementing
    the most requested feature in our hosting service, Galaxy, and rewriting the network interface and data management layer
    of our GraphQL client, Apollo Client. You can read a lot more about their work and experiences in the summaries below.

      <p>Evans joined the Open Source team and worked on Apollo Client, our caching GraphQL client. His main project was focusing
        on making Apollo Client's network layer more flexible. He created
        <a class="link" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-link/">apollo-link</a>, a framework
        for GraphQL clients that composes links, discrete modules that contain different functionality in a network stack.
        He also created
        <a class="link" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-fetch">apollo-fetch</a>, a lightweight
        fetcher with middleware and afterware that provides a transition for Apollo Clientâ€™s current network interface. With
        this transition path, Apollo Link is a core part of Apollo Client 2.0 and will be a large part of the future of customizing
        GraphQL clients.

      <p>Steven worked on several projects during his internship at Meteor. He refactored the <a class="link" target="_blank"
          href="https://github.com/meteor/meteor/pull/8820">boilerplate-generator</a> Meteor package to remove its dependency
        on external templating engines, making it possible for developers to remove the blaze package from their servers
        and reduce their bundle size. He also improved meteor's accounts system by
        <a class="link" target="blank" href="https://github.com/meteor/meteor/pull/8917">fixing a bug</a> that mistakenly
        expired tokens. Towards the end of the summer, he worked on Apollo-related projects, including Apollo Client and
        Optics. On Optics, he worked on frontend features that enabled searching through a list of queries. On Apollo Client,
        he worked on improving the performance of the query store as well as on giving the dev tools more access to the internals
        of Apollo Client.

      <p>Klaire joined the Services team and has touched every part of the stacks that our commercial products run on. She started
        by working on Galaxy and implementing some of the most highly request user features. She built a <a class="link"
          target="_blank" href="https://blog.meteor.com/easily-restore-prior-versions-in-galaxy-ff94d5d519fe">new page</a>        in Galaxy that shows users a list of all the versions of their app that have been deployed, and allows users to quickly
        and easily restore to any given app version in the history log. She also improved the safety of app deployments by
        writing a checker that tests wether or not a version will successfully have a healthy deploy before rolling all that
        app's machines to the new version. Towards to end of the summer, Klaire also started doing a lot of frontend feature
        work for MDG's next commercial product.

      <p>Aashish joined the Services team and spent the summer writing a GraphQL proxy, which will be part of one of MDG's next
        commercial products. The piece that he built is the thing that sits in between the GraphQL server and its client.
        He worked closely with our product team and backend devs to identify product requirements and implement the first
        few features the product offers, which we released in a private early-access program during the last week of his
        internship.

      <p>Ramya joined the Open Source team and spent the first part of the summer re-designing and implementing a new data loading
        bridge in the <a class="link" target="_blank" href="https://dev-blog.apollodata.com/inspecting-your-graphql-client-in-the-browser-2481f8bcdd55">Apollo Client Devtools</a>,
        to more efficiently pass data through the chrome extension. She improved the data loading process by changing it
        from a polling-based system to a push-based system. Later in the summer, she worked on some of the other Apollo open
        source projects, namely adding front-end features to <a class="link" target="_blank" href="https://launchpad.graphql.com/">Apollo Launchpad</a>        using various React libraries. She also wrote a long-awaited tutorial on pagination using Apollo Client.</p>

      <p>Shadaj joined the open source team and worked on building out a new Cache API for the Apollo Client, which makes it
        possible for external developers to create their own cache implementations for Apollo. This makes it possible to
        have caches that work offline or have tradeoffs of correctness of performance. Another project he worked on was a
        <a class="link" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/apollographql/react-apollo-scalajs">Scala.js wrapper</a>        for Apollo Client that lets you write a React app with Apollo Client in Scala, and have Scala.js compile that to
        JavaScript to run in the browser. This included a contribution to <a class="link" target="_blank" href="https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-codegen">apollo-codegen</a>        to add a target to generate static Scala types based on GraphQL queries.</p>
