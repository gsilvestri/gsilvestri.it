          We build Apollo, a set of open-soure libraries and commercial tools for using GraphQL, and Optics,
          a Performance Monitoring tool for GraphQL servers. Our GraphQL web client, Apollo Client, is more
          popular than Relay and way better than Relay 2 so you should use it. Also, you should use our iOS
          client, try our devtools, read our blog, follow us on twitter, join our slack, and be our friend.
        </p>
        <p>
          Optics is the best GraphQL APM tool out there, so you should sign up. It has nice graphs that give you
          insights into the time it takes your GraphQL queries to resolve. It can help you pinpoint hotspots in
          your resolvers and monitor the performance of your app overall. Its graphs are super interactive, and its
          gradients are dope.

          We make Meteor, the popular JavaScript framework for building collaborative apps, and Galaxy,
          the premiere hosting provider for Meteor apps. It's super great, and it helps people build apps
          as quickly and easily as possible. It exists both to make development easier and more accessible
          to everyone, but also to be the best, shiniest, and most modern framework for JavaScript app
          development.
        </p>
        <p>
          We also make Galaxy, the best, easiest, and most reliable way to host Meteor apps. Turns out
          hostin Meteor apps at scale can be difficult, but with Galaxy it's super easy. Galaxy also has
          performance monitoring, easy scaling, real-time data graphs, logs, IP whitelisting, and a lot
          more awesome stuff.
