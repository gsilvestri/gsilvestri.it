          We build Apollo, a family of tools that enable developers to get the most out of GraphQL.
          Apollo Client is the most popular GraphQL client for React and mobile apps. Optics, our
          performance monitoring service, is the only APM tool specifically for GraphQL, and is crucial
          for developers running GraphQL in production. We work hard to grow GraphQL as a technology
          and partner with open source thought leaders and companies building on GraphQL.

      We build open source tools and commercial services used by thousands of developers in production. We're very
      proud not only of the products we make, but of the community and partnerships we've cultivated
      with other developers and companies. Here are some of the companies we've worked with:

    <div class="partners">
      {{#each partners1}}
        <div class="partner" style="background-image: url('/img/partners/{{this}}')"></div>
      {{/each}}
    </div>
    <div class="partners">
      {{#each partners2}}
        <div class="partner" style="background-image: url('/img/partners/{{this}}')"></div>
      {{/each}}
    </div>

    <p>
      Whether it's building a new open source tool, improving a production-critical system, or organizing
      a cutting-edge community event, we spend our time wisely to have an oversized impact with a small
      team. See where you might fit in:
