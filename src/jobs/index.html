    <p>
      We are a small and talented team, spread across the globe, that is dedicated to helping developers
      build great apps. Everyone here is passionate about making software development easier, better,
      and more accessible to more people.
    </p>

    <p>
      We care deeply about the personal and professional growth of all our people during their time at
      MDG, and we work hard to maintain a caring and inclusive environment that is transparent,
      respectful, and apolitical.

    <h4 class="subtitle">Global Team</h4>

    <p>
      We love working with the most talented people we can find across the globe. Having a remote-first
      team is core to our company's culture, and we use the latest systems possible to ensure seamless
      collaboration between our remoterites and those in HQ. In addition to using Slack for important
      conversations and Quip for documentation, we have high-quality videoconferencing and we record
      all meetings so they can be watched asynchronously for those in different timezones.
    </p>

    <p>
      We also believe that face-to-face interaction is a key part of reinforcing a strong team, so we
      have a travel calendar for our remote team members to come to HQ to work and celebrate with the
      SF-based team every quarter.
