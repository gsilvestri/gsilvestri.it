    <h2 class="pagetitle">People at Meteor</h2>

    <p>
      We're a small, close-knit group of writers, evangelists, event hosts, designers, product devs,
      systems experts, and many other things. We accomplish a remarkable amount of work for our size
      because we're passionate about what we do and we have grand aspirations of making software
      development as fast, easy, and accessible as possible.
    </p>

    <p>
      We love building tools for developers because we're all nerds at heart and many of us come from
      a technical background. Our founders originally met as undergrads at MIT, and invented
      the Meteor platform after inadvertently writing most of it to power their original travel app idea.

      A quote from Nick here about the company's core culture and values (or something like that) would
      be fantastic :)
