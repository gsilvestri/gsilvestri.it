# MDG Jobs Site

This page is static, but we're using Less, so if you would like to develop the page without having
to recompile the Less file to CSS every time you make a change, run:

```
./compile-style
```

This will recompile the Less file for you every second automatically, so you don't have to worry
about it. You must have `lessc` installed.
